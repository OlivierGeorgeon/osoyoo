Welcome!! Bienvenue!! Tunngasugit!!

(I am in Canada -- these are our official languages -- English, French and a semi-official third (indigenous) language of Inuktitut.)

You have already built your Osoyoo Robot Car and learned how to modify and upload its software (well.... change some parameters at least). 

In this second part to our adventure, we will now turn the toy-like robot car into a serious Python controlled autonomous robot.

Saddle up!! Let's get going on the most exciting part of our journey....
