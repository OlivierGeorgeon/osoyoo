<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">The PetitCat Project </h2>


The "Easy-to-Read Overview" of the project is divided into five parts:

**Part I:** The Basics: Assembly, Software and Using

**Part II:** Modifying the Robot Car for Python Control

**Part III:** Active Inference of the Robot Car

**Part IV:** Integration of PetitCat with a Causal Cognitive Architecture

**Part V:** Integration of PetitCat with a Large Language Model


The PetitCat documentation is written so that anyone with a basic education can read it and understand it. Having a deeper breadth of knowledge in software development, AI, or cognitive science, can, of course, allow greater appreciation for certain aspects of the project.

-Part I does not require any specialized background knowledge. You should be familiar with moving files around in either your Windows, Mac or Linux desktop/laptop computer. Other than that, no specialized knoweldge is needed. Part I is perfectly fine for high school students and hobbyists.

-Part II may be fine for high school students, college students and hobbyists as well, given a willingness of some effort to learn things here and there. However, the documentation will guide you on this learning journey. The lower level software of the PetitCat project is written in C\C++ in the Arduino IDE. You don't need to know these languages or environment in order to use Python with the project. However, we provide a very basic C\C++\Arduino tutorial which may be sufficient for most readers who do want to have a bit more control over the Arduino board coding. We just touch upon the Python control of the project at the end of Part II, so you are not expected to have much Python knowledge in this part, unless you want to start modifying the Python files.

-Part III really only requires some knowledge of Python. You do not have to be an expert developer. More important, is perhaps a background in AI or cognitive science. However, there is no real background prerequisite here. Regardless of the reader's background, we provide gentle tutorials on a number of topics, and guide the learner through the concepts of active inference and implementing it in the PetitCat project.

-Part IV has similar requirements. In this part we take a functioning system, i.e., the PetitCat robot car and software, and integrate it with a cognitive architecture. The result is a true grounded system capable of autonomous operation. Again, in this part, only intermediate (or even novice) Python coding abilities are required. 

-In Part V we will add the full capabilities (depending on software releases and licensing) of a large language model (GPT4 at the time of this writing) into the PetitCat cognitive architecture robot car system. Again, in this part, only intermediate (or even novice) Python coding abilities are required. However, we will gently guide you through the project, so that you end up with a super-human intelligent grounded autonomous robot system.

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Step #1 -- The Biggest Questions in the Universe</h1>

In this step we think about what are the biggest questions in the universe and then we saddle up, and go on to start answering these questions. 

Do not be hesitant. Regardless of your skill level, you have made it this far -- you have built a robot car with your hands, you have learned how to move software around (Part I) and then you learned how to write some software in C/C++, build electronic circuits and make the software control the electronics (Part II). Then you learned how to code in Python and demonstrated active inference (Part III). Now here you are.

The biggest questions in the Universe may differ to each person. However, here this documentation takes the the three biggest questions in the Universe to be:

1. What is space and time and where did all this come from?

2. How does our brain work?

3. How can we create an AGI that works even better than our brain, better than any large language model, i.e., something human but extraordinarily functioning?

Question #1 is not for us to answer, and despite the work of Einstein et al., it obviously still remains unanswered.  However, in this Part IV we will answer question #2 -- the PetitCat project will take on a form similar to a model of the human brain that explains how it works and how it evolved -- question #2 answered.  And then in Part V we will build from the work we have done in these four parts, an AGI that is human in its core (question #3).

Saddle up -- the Universe and its big questions await you!!
