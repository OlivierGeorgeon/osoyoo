<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">The PetitCat Project </h2>




The "Easy-to-Read Overview" of the project is divided into a number of parts:

**Part I:** The Basics: Assembly, Software and Using

**Part II:** Modifying the Robot Car for Python Control

**Part III:** Interfacing your Python Code with the PetitCat Project

**Part IV:** Modifying the C/C++ for your Selected Robotic Embodiment

**Part V:** Integration of PetitCat with a Causal Cognitive Architecture

**Part VI:** Integration of PetitCat with a Large Language Model

**Part VII:** Active Inference of the Robot Car


The PetitCat documentation is written so that anyone with a basic education can read it and understand it. Having a deeper breadth of knowledge in software development, AI, or cognitive science, can, of course, allow greater appreciation for certain aspects of the project.

-Part I does not require any specialized background knowledge. You should be familiar with moving files around in either your Windows, Mac or Linux desktop/laptop computer. Other than that, no specialized knoweldge is needed. Part I is perfectly fine for high school students and hobbyists.

-Part II may be fine for high school students, college students and hobbyists as well, given a willingness of some effort to learn things here and there. However, the documentation will guide you on this learning journey. The lower level software of the PetitCat project is written in C\C++ in the Arduino IDE. You don't need to know these languages or environment in order to use Python with the project. However, we provide a very basic C\C++\Arduino tutorial which may be sufficient for most readers who do want to have a bit more control over the Arduino board coding. We just touch upon the Python control of the project at the end of Part II, so you are not expected to have much Python knowledge in this part, unless you want to start modifying the Python files.

-Part III is where the PetitCat project becomes more useful -- interfacing the Python code of your AI/AGI project with the PetitCat projects.

-Part IV allows you to modify the Arduino C/C++ code to use other robotic embodiments than the default robot car, or to add addtional sensors and actuators to the robot car.

-In Part V and VI we will integrate the PetitCat project with a cognitive architecture and then a large language model. Again, in this part, only intermediate (or even novice) Python coding abilities are required. However, we will gently guide you through the project, so that you end up with a super-human intelligent grounded autonomous robot system.

-Part VII really only requires some knowledge of Python. You do not have to be an expert developer. More important, is perhaps a background in AI or cognitive science. However, there is no real background prerequisite here. Regardless of the reader's background, we provide gentle tutorials on a number of topics, and guide the learner through the concepts of active inference and implementing it in the PetitCat project.

 We will also further modify the robot car, starting with changing the wiring of the servomechanism shortly below. Then we will go on to further modify our robot car with a digital compass, inertial measurement unit and a color sensor. Then we will consider the Python code controlling all this. If you don't know how to code in Python there are many excellent free courses available and you can still do this project. (However, I am assuming anyone doing this project and wanting to interface real-world hardware with their Python code, knows how to code the latter.) Then we will move on to consider Active Inference and how the robot car demonstrates this important principle. 

You made it this far, and you will succeed again in this part.  Get on that horse. Saddle up!!

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Step #2 -- Rewiring the ServoMechanism</h1>



## The head servo is overheating



## Optionally change the servo

The servo `LACC200610` provided by Osoyoo was jittering when the wheels were moving. I replaced it with the `SG90` servo from my Elegoo kit, which solved the problem.


# Modify some wiring

We have modified some wiring from the original osoyoo robot as listed in Table 1.

Table 1: Wiring modification

|Original |Modified ||
|---|---|---|
|5|23| Rear  Right Motor direction pin 1|
|6|25| Rear  Right Motor direction pin 2|
|13|6|Head servo pin|

Pins 5 and 6 were moved to 23 and 25 because they don't need the PWM functionality. These pins are declared in the file `Wheel.h`.

Pin 13 was moved to pin 6 because we are using the arduino onboard LED that is also connected to Pin 13. The head servo pin is declared in the file `Robot_define.h`.

# Connect the IMU card

Connect the IMU card to the wifi Shield following Table 2 and Figure 1. 
Note that the calibration offset varies significantly depending on the position of the card on the robot. 

Table 2: IMU Wiring

|GY-86 Imu|MEGA2560 Wifi Shield|
|---|---|
|Vcc|3v3|
|GND|GND|
|SCL|SCL|
|SDA|SDA|

Figure 1: wiring of GY-86 imu

# Connect the color sensor

Use the "long" two-hole version of the TCS34725. It has two LEDs, and the holes miraculously match holes on the robot platform (Figure 4).
Wire it to the Arduino MEGA according to Table 3. 
Use PINs 20 and 21 for SDA and SCL because the other SDA and SCL PINs are used for the IMU. They are the same. 
For the power line, I used the 3v yellow PINs on the Wifi Shield. 
Alternatively, the VIN PIN can be connected to a 5V PIN (red).

|TCS34725 |MEGA2560 ||
|---|---|---|
|3v3|3v| On the Wifi Shield, yellow slots|
|GND|GND| On the Wifi Shield, black|
|SDA|SDA 20| |
|SCL|SCL 21| |
|LED|53|Digital output|

# The emotion LED

Install a common cathode RGB LED as shown below.

|RGB LED | |MEGA2560 / Wifi shield|
|---|---|---|
|Blue|| 2 |
|Green|| 3 |
|GND|10kÎ© resistor| GND |
|Red|| 5 |
