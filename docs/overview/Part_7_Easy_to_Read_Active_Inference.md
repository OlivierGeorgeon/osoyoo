# An Easy-to-Read Overview of the Robot Car ("PetitCat") Project
# Part VII

![petitcatgpt4logo](petitcatgpt4logo.jpg)


## The PetitCat Project


---------------

Step by step explanations for beginners and researchers alike. The documentation is intended to give any user a pleasant experience with the project regardless of how seriously they intend to make use of the project. An issue for many researchers in using GitHub software is that it more often fails to work (or work properly) mainly because the thousands of litte things in the heads of the developers are not made clear to the non-involved user. Here we have gone to the other extreme, to make sure that the hardware and software will work for any user, although the more advanced topics are geared towards researchers rather than students. We have paid much attention to the main causes of poor GitHub and other open source software usability: incomplete documentation, dependency issues, environment configuration, version mismatches, non-graceful error handling, permissions and access, network/connectivity issues, stability, indadequate testing, user prerequisite knowledge. Easy-to-read, guaranteed-to-work and inexpensive may surprise you in producing an example of a superhuman AGI with robotic embodiment.

----------------


The "Easy-to-Read Overview" of the project is divided into a number of parts:

**Part I:** The Basics: Assembly, Software and Using

**Part II:** Modifying the Robot Car for Python Control

**Part III:** Interfacing your Python Code with the PetitCat Project

**Part IV:** Modifying the C/C++ for your Selected Robotic Embodiment

**Part V:** Integration of PetitCat with a Causal Cognitive Architecture

**Part VI:** Integration of PetitCat with a Large Language Model

**Part VII:** Active Inference of the Robot Car


The PetitCat documentation is written so that anyone with a basic education can read it and understand it. Having a deeper breadth of knowledge in software development, AI, or cognitive science, can, of course, allow greater appreciation for certain aspects of the project.

- Part I does not require any specialized background knowledge. You should be familiar with moving files around in either your Windows, Mac or Linux desktop/laptop computer. Other than that, no specialized knoweldge is needed. Part I is perfectly fine for high school students and hobbyists.

- Part II may be fine for high school students, college students and hobbyists as well, given a willingness of some effort to learn things here and there. However, the documentation will guide you on this learning journey. The lower level software of the PetitCat project is written in C\C++ in the Arduino IDE. You don't need to know these languages or environment in order to use Python with the project. However, we provide a very basic C\C++\Arduino tutorial which may be sufficient for most readers who do want to have a bit more control over the Arduino board coding. We just touch upon the Python control of the project at the end of Part II, so you are not expected to have much Python knowledge in this part, unless you want to start modifying the Python files.

- Part III is where the PetitCat project becomes more useful -- interfacing the Python code of your AI/AGI project with the PetitCat projects.

- Part IV allows you to modify the Arduino C/C++ code to use other robotic embodiments than the default robot car, or to add addtional sensors and actuators to the robot car.

- In Parts V and VI we will integrate the PetitCat project with a cognitive architecture and then a large language model. Again, in this part, only intermediate (or even novice) Python coding abilities are required. However, we will gently guide you through the project, so that you end up with a super-human intelligent grounded autonomous robot system.

- Part VII really only requires some knowledge of Python. You do not have to be an expert developer. More important, is perhaps a background in AI or cognitive science. However, there is no real background prerequisite here. Regardless of the reader's background, we provide gentle tutorials on a number of topics, and guide the learner through the concepts of active inference and implementing it in the PetitCat project.

(Yes..... borrowed from Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu -- something we all can relate to. Humans are not LLM's. Our ways of thinking and communicating (i.e., writing) are deeply human in method, and create our representation of the world around us with regard to space, time and memories of time.)
