# An Easy-to-Read Overview of the Robot Car Project

Welcome!! Bienvenue!! Tunngasugit!!

(I am in Canada -- these are our official languages -- English, French and a semi-official third (indigenous) language of Inuktitut.)

If you are interested in starting this project, you should read this file first. 

Why? Because it is written from from a first-person viewpoint that tries to answer the big questions of why do this project, how to start, how to implement, and so on. If you think back to learning a new subject in university -- wasn't it better to get tutorial help from a friend who just learned it rather than someone who had already knew the subject for twenty years?  That's because the new learner has in his/her brain the steps that need to be overcome, while the experienced person has integrated these steps and may not teach them.
I am that new learner -- trying to figure out how to even start this project. Let me guide you into what I believe you will find will be a very advantageous and satisfying project.


**Busy Life Note**

I am super busy until the middle of February 2024 -- thus I will update this project readme/wiki slowly until then. By mid February I will start writing much more often.
Any questions before? Please email me to:  hschneidermd@alum.mit.edu

**Why Build a Robot Car?**

Embodiment is crucial to the emergence of real AGI, as well as understanding the operation of the mammalian brain.
For a good overview of the importance of grounding your AI/AGI please consider my paper:
[cca5 inductive analogical soln to grounding problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389041722000493?via%3Dihub)
[archive preprint](https://github.com/howard8888/insomnia/blob/master/analogical%20inductive%20preprint.pdf)

Even if Tesla Bots, for sake of example, were available, you wouldn't want to use such a complex system for the prototype stages of your AI/AGI project or theoretical project. You want a capable but simple enough robotic system that you have direct access to via Python, which is what this robotic car project allows. You will now have an embodiment to use with your AI/AGI. Even if you working mainly theoretically, the robotic car project can be very useful in terms of demonstrations and proof of concept.

**Step #1 -- Decide if you want to do the Project**

Your first step should be to decide to build this robotic car project. Are you working on an AI/AGI project that it could be useful for? (Actually, it is probably useful for most projects, including LLMs.) Do you have an interest in robotics and would like to see an interface to an AI project?

In terms of monetary cost expect to spend about US$200 on the project (I know the Amazon.com prices are not this high, but shipping to other countries, extra parts from AliExpress, etc will push up the price). 

In terms of electronics expertise, very little is needed if everything gets assembled correctly and all parts are working. If you want to modify the design, if there is more advanced troubleshooting, then of course more is better.
In terms of software expertise, you need to be comfortable moving around files and using Python. The Arduino IDE and code you can install and copy without great expertise. Of course, if you have the time, you can spend more hours getting more expertise in the Arduino ecosystem and the lower level Python routines.

**Step #2 -- Purchase the Robot Car kit**
