# An Easy-to-Read Overview of the Robot Car Project

Welcome!! Bienvenue!! Tunngasugit!!

(I am in Canada -- these are our official languages -- English, French and a semi-official third (indigenous) language of Inuktitut.)

If you are interested in starting this project, you should read this file first. Why? Because it is written from from a first-person viewpoint that tries to answer the big questions of why do this project, how to start, how to implement, and so on. If you think back to learning a new subject in university -- wasn't it better to get tutorial help from a friend who just learned it rather than someone who had already knew the subject for twenty years?  That's because the new learner has in his/her brain the steps that need to be overcome, while the experienced person has integrated these steps and may not teach them.
I am that new learner -- trying to figure out how to even start this project. Let me guide you into what I believe you will find will be a very advantageous and satisfying project.


**Busy Life Note**

I am super busy until the middle of February 2024 -- thus I will update this project page slowly until then. By mid February I will start writing much more often.
Any questions before? Please email me to:  hschneidermd@alum.mit.edu
